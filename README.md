# Orange-Confort-plus
The target of _Orange Confort+_ functionalities is to enhance user experience on web sites, which are already accessible, or still accessible.

_Orange Confort+_ provides these services:

* Typography - user may change: font size, space between words, characters and lines, font-face to Open Dyslexic
* Layout: cancel layout, text align left, numbering list items, modify navigation links appearance, display a reading ruler
* Colors : Modify foreground/background colors
* Behavior: direct access to main content on page load, automatic selection of page clickable elements with a user defined delay, page scrolling on simple user on hover.

Be careful, _Orange Confort+_ does not improve the accessibility level of a web site: blocking points still stay blocking points, with or without _Orange Confort+_.
